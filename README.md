# Failure demand analysis
The materials in this project were done as a part of a master's thesis that studied failure demand from a Finnish wellbeing service county's healthcare units. More detailed explanations about the data collection form and about the general investment model can be found from the master's thesis. The master's thesis can be found from this link: (link added soon). The data collection form is used to collect data about failure demand amount and different failure demand types in healthcare primary care service. The model is used to assess the economic feasibility of failure demand mitigation.

Data collection form

The data collection form can be used to evaluate the different failure demand types and amount in a healthcare organizations primary care services. The form has compiled different failure demand types from academic literature. The form is intended to be used to track if incoming phone call subjects from customers are failure demand or not. 

How to use the form
A professional answers or makes a callback to a customer. From the phone call the professional identifies if the customer's contact reason is failure demand or value demand reflecting on the data collection formâ€™s categorization. After the identification, the professional keeps a record of the number of contact types on the form paper or on the form Excel page.

General failure demand investment model

The general failure demand investment model is a stylized generalized investment model for mitigating failure demand, intended to be use to model how the costs and possible cost savings may accumulate over time when addressing failure demand. The model has scenario analysis of realistic, optimistic and pessimistic scenario estimates for net present value, internal rate of return, profitability indicator, and payback period. These profitability analysis indicators give more information about the potential profitability of the investment, creating a more thorough analysis of the investment.
